Condition variables (also known as condvars) provide a basic resource
management queueing mechanism.  The basic principle of a condvar is that it
allows a context to check for some condition and then go to sleep if the
condition isn't met.  Another context may make a change that affects the
conditional check and wake the sleeper.  In order to ensure consistency of data
both contexts use the same lock to protect the condition, with the sleeper
relinquishing the lock as it goes to sleep and awaking holding it once more.

There is one additional element to the Liquorice implementation of condvars; a
context sleeping whilst waiting for a condition to change can be interrupted
by another context.  Typically this would be done to provide a "time-out"
mechanism via a software-settable timer.  By setting a timer before going to
sleep a context can "know" that it will wake up when the timer expires if it
isn't woken by another context.
