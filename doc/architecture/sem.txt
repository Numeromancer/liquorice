The sem library provides counting semaphores.  These can be used to synchronize
access to system resources, in particular only allowing a fixed number of
contexts (one or more) to gain access to the resource at any one time.

Counting semaphores provide a basic resource management queueing mechanism.
The basic principle of a counting semaphore is that it allows a fixed number
of contexts (one or more) to access a resource, but that any attempt by other
contexts will cause them to go to sleep until one of the ones that currently
has access to the resource relinquishes it.

There is one additional element to the Liquorice implementation of counting
semaphores; a context sleeping whilst waiting for a semaphore can be
interrupted by another context.  Typically this would be done to provide a
"time-out" mechanism via a software-settable timer.  By setting a timer before
going to sleep a context can "know" that it will wake up when the timer expires
if it isn't woken by another context.
