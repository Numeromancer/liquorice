Special Exception To the GNU General Public License For Liquorice


Preamble

Whilst the GNU General Public License is generally suitable for most operating
system applications within a workstation or server environment, it presents
certain obstacles that prevent its wide acceptance within many embedded
application fields.  In particular the requirements that prevent the linking
of software licensed under the GPL with software that is not licensed under
the GPL present a serious problem to many would-be users who for various
reasons are unable to comply with this.

With this in mind, Liquorice is released with the a special exception
to the GNU Public License that permits some additional uses of the software.


Special Exception

If you choose to link software from Liquorice with other files to produce an
executable, this does not by itself cause the resulting executable to be
covered by the GNU General Public License.  Your use of the executable is in
no way restricted on account of linking the Liquorice code with it.

This exception does not however invalidate any other reason why the executable
file might be covered by the GNU General Public License.

This exception applies only to the code released by David J. Hudson and any
other identified copyright holder under the name Liquorice.  If you copy other
code that is released by its copyright holder under the GNU General Public
License into a copy of Liquorice, as the GNU General Public License permits,
then this exception does not apply to the code that you add in this way.  To
avoid misleading anyone as to the status of such modified files, you must
delete references to this exception notice from them.

If you write modifications of your own for Liquorice, it is you choice whether
to permit this exception to apply to your modifications.  If you do not wish
this, delete references to this exception notice from the affected files.
