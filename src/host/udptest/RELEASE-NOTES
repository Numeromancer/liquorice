Release Notes For "udptest" 20000701a
-------------------------------------

This test program simply sends a single UDP packet to a specified host and
port.  It is intended to be used in conjunction with the standard Linux
networking utility "tcpdump".


---------------
Using "udptest"
---------------

updtest takes 2 optional parameters:

	-h <hostname> - host to target.
	-p <port> - port to target.
	
When it's run, "udptest" sends a single UDP packet to the target host and
port, allowing the target to respond as it wishes.

Generally it is suggested that "tcpdump -vv -i<interface>" be run as root
on another virtual terminal/console so that all of the network transactions
can be monitored.  Note that "<interface>" will usually be something like
"eth0" or "sl0".

"tcpdump" will show all of the inbound and outbound packets, including any
errors and ICMP messages.


--------
Platform
--------

"udptest" has been designed to operate under Linux v2.2 or later.  It may
work on other platforms, however no others have been tested.  Whilst it may
be possible to build this under Microsoft Windows (95, 98, NT, 2000, etc), its
usefulness will be limited unless you have something equivalent to "tcpdump".


--------------------------------
Changes since snapshot 20000616a
--------------------------------

	* Added a message to indicate which host and port are to be sent
	  the packet.
	
	* Updated this release notes file to explain how this test
	  program might be used.
