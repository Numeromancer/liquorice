Tests Details
-------------

This test program demonstrates a very simple configuration running on a small
hardware platform (single-chip in fact).  It initializes the heap, threading
system (which implicitly creates the idle thread) and then launches 2 test
threads which alternate displaying messages on the debug LCD.

Probably a better demonstration here would be to only use the context library
rather than the thread library, and not launch the idle thread.  This would
make more space to have perhaps 4 test threads running.  The test does however
show Liquorice working on a very small setup.


------------------
Supported Hardware
------------------

The software expects to run on a standard STK200 evaluation board from Kanda
Systems fitted with an AT90S8515.  It does not need any external RAM or the
address latch, however it does expect to use a standard 16x2 LCD (attached to
the LCD expansion header) at 0x8000 and 0xc000.


-----------------
Building The Code
-----------------

The code has been built and tested under Linux using avr-gcc v2.95.2 and a
fairly standard set of GNU utilities.  I don't believe there's anything too
obscure in any of it.  I haven't switched any of the assembly code to Denis'
new convention where "r15" would simply become "15" - I don't know if my code
breaks when this happens, but I'd be interested in any feedback.

To build the code, ensure that the "at90s8515" libraries have been built and
intalled in the "lib" directory, modify the Makefile in this directory as
necessary, and run "make".
